/*
What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer: O(n^2) because the function uses two nested loops. the outer loop iterates n times and the inner loop iterates
roughly n times as well. Therefore the time complexity is (n * n = n^2) => O(n^2)
